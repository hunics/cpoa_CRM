<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;">Part of our process involves calling your Resort Management Company on your behalf. For example, we will change the contact information on the account right away, so that we can manage the transfer correspondence. This minimizes the amount of work that you are involved in. It is very important that you DO NOT contact your Resort Management Company once we have started the transfer work. If they contact you, please DO NOT mention that the transfer is being managed by a professional transfer agency. There are many resorts that will charge you additional transfer fees, will significantly delay the transfer, or will refuse the transfer completely if they are aware that the transfer is being managed by a professional transfer agency. If they call, please just say that the buyer is handling the transfer process, and ask them to call us at: (979)-987-3730.</p>
